                    Leadership Without Borders (LWB) was created with Undocumented Students in mind and with the mission to serve as a launch pad for studentsâ€™ leadership, a space for community building, and a connection point for awareness as well as to resources and services for undocumented students.
                    The program offers leadership development resources, meeting space, artwork, a textbook lending library, and an atmosphere designed to provide both aspiration and inspirational aspects for multi-ethnic, multi-identity, and multi-national communities.
                    We invite you to learn more about the history, services, and stories that embody Leadership Without Borders.
